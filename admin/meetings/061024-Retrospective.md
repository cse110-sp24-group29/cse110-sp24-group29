# Agile - Retrospective


## What went well
- The team was able to organize and lead multiple in-person meetings to update everyone and share progress.
- Members were able to write and share code, set up multiple branches, and resolve merging conflicts smoothly throughout the development process with help from the CI/CD pipeline.
- The team was able to successfully develop functionality for features such as the project cards, the skill chart, the note entries, the milestone and task lists, and the project timelines.

## What didn't go well
- Because our design ideas changed after meeting with the professor, the team had to pivot and we lost some development time.


## Things that we learned
- Obtain feedback earlier, it would have given us more time to pivot and create a higher quality product. 


## Sprint Goal (Things we could do better next time)
- Be more prompt when it comes to completing and sharing work with the team and pushing to the main branch
